{"text":"Microwaves are terrible. Everyone in this sub should know that they have no good culinary purpose. The reason they leave unpopped kernels is because they heat unevenly. Inside the microwave oven there are hotspots and there are coldspots. The rotating dish things try to mitigate this but it's still a problem. The best way to do it is to not use the microwave. Simple as that. Learn to do it in a pan. It's almost as easy as boiling water. This question is a bit like \"how do I blanch vegetables in the oven\". Use the right tool for the job.","meta":{"section":"Cooking","utc":"1368260826"}}
